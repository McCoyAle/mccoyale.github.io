# The Story of the Last Cargo

I really tried to like this book. I promise I did. I did not finish it, but plan to finish it at a later date. The beginning of the book which talks about Barracoon's childhood and culture prior to bring brought to America was really interesting. However, due to the way the book was written it was really hard to follow along. The book is written to keep his accounts in what would be his accent. Likely a deep rooted southern accent that mixed with his native tongue. I can truly appreciate that, but I believe the mental space I maintained when I started this book just did not allow me to focus.

I don't have much else to say, and maybe I will provide an update when I am able to complete it. I do not think it is a bad read at all, but maybe should have started this later in my readings.

If you would like to follow along, check out my [2020 Reading Challenge](_posts/2020-01-01-reading-list-2020.md) project.
