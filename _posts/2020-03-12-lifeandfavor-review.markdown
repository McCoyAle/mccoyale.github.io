# Life and Favor Review

This review is ABSOLUTELY LATE!!! I am terrible, but actually had to make time to study for my CKA exam. Ya know....the thing I was supposed to be studying for when I first bumped into Jekyll, GitHub Pages, and decided to read outside of work. Yea, I had to get back to that. Will definitely let update on how that works out *rolls eyes*.

Anywhoo, I really hate to say this, but I wanted to like this book so much. I really did. It was a quick read, and I guess not disappointing when considering the author is just someone I follow off of Instagram. It felt a bit rushed and certain parts I would have enjoyed more if they went into further detail.

The one thing I will say is, I truly truly truly appreciated the author's story. If I remember correctly, it was her story and about her childhood. How she overcame certain obstacles. And boy, were there some obstacles. I can relate to facing obstacles and overcoming them, but definitely not some of the situations she encountered. I could not imagine.

I honestly cannot remember much about the book, so I am not going to go on a rant. I am always glad to support others, so I won't complain when looking at it from that perspective. However, I am not sure I would recommend this book to anyone. I have another from this author, and I do hope that it has a bit more depth.

As for how the overall challenge is going, I am still on target. "Hip Hip...Hoooraaaayy"!!! I am currently on book 5. I might get behind in April due to upcoming studies. I also cannot wait to sit and write the reviews for the other 2 books. I'd recommend both! Maybe I will find some time this weekend to write about those and make some changes to the site.

If you would like to follow along, check out my [2020 Reading Challenge](2020-01-01-reading-list-2020.md) project. I have added 2 new books. One is a book that was lying around and I figured I would read it. Another I have to purchase. I do have some hidden gems in my bookcase that I may re read as well.
