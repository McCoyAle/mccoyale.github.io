# Gucci Mane Autobiography

Yea, so this was definitely a shocker....in a good way. I really enjoyed Gucci's autobiography. I think when you hear the name Gucci Mane you just think of the typical rapper from the hood stereotype...sold drugs, made money, rapped about nothing, partied etc. The good thing is, I am a fan of his and knew a little about his story. Another thing that I also knew is that he went to college. Not to say many haven't, but I consider it to be a fun fact that many do not know nor would they assume about him.

My favorite thing about the book was the flow of events. I enjoyed the intro that gave a bit of family background. Especially when we consider the history of his grandfather and father. It provided a lot of insight and explanations as to who he is today and why. Even down to how he inherited his rap name.

Something that stood out to me, and is similar to Gabby's Memoir, is not holding back on the good or bad. I mean lets be real, Gucci did some grimey stuff lol. But he did not leave it out, or sugar coat it, or make up excuses for it. I can appreciate that because I am a firm believer we can learn from hearing other people's story, the good and the bad. Often, people are judged for it. I try to find the beauty in different life journey's....no matter how chaotic the story. I can't imagine how boring a perfect world would be.

If you would like to follow along, check out my [2020 Reading Challenge](_posts/2020-01-01-reading-list-2020.md) project. ion exam. The exam that got me started on this Jekyll/GitHub blog. So that is definitely a huge goal accomplished and I hope to get back on track here.
