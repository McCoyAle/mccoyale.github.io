# The Public Assault on America's Children

I am not exactly sure as to where I should start with this review. I am uber late, per usual. However, this was an extremely good read. If you are looking for something that is a big more evidence based then this is the book for you. However, with that comes the responsbility of taking your time and allowing yourself to absorb and think about the information presented in order to retain it. Yes, it is one of those books but very much worth the read.

This book is apart of a social justice series, of which I have another that is apart of this series. It is a book that I ordered a couple of years ago but never got around to reading. It is also a book that I will keep on my bookshelf and reread at a later date.

I have a soft spot for today's youth, especially when it pertains to inner city and impoverished youth. This book touches on the impact of touch policies aimed at children. Now, it discusses children at large, but if we are going to be candid, I believe we all understand the demographic that this consists of. Before I accidentally started in the tech field, I worked as a pretrial coordinator with alleged offenders of the adult and adolescent ages. Even though I am not in that space anymore, I have to admit that that is where my passion is and where I hope to return some day. There is just something about speaking for those that cannot speak for themselves at the level required. The funny thing is, I remember when I first joined the tech field and I would interview with companies that have a global presence. A question that was always asked was what did I know about the company, and I would alway circle back to whatever programs and initiatives they had with the youth of today. My thought process was, if I have to work 50 plus hours and slave for you, I at least want to know that you are contributing to something that I am passionate about.

I am a talker and do not want to go off on a tangent *smiles*.

This book, for me, couples that passion with the misguided policies that are implemented against the youth of today in our society. Whenever discussing this topic, I prefer to deal with policies and evidence based statistics and solutions. This book does just that. As touchy as these topics can be, when I started reading the first chapters the book broke down how religion, socioeconomic, political and cultural traditions plays a role in governing life in our current society. It goes into detail about the different contradictions that contribute to violence against children. Now...it is important to understand that violence is not used in just a physical sense here. Violence can also present itself in the contradicting beliefs, political traditions, and thoughts shaped by culture and socioeconomic situations. Altogether, it shapes itself within this system that negatively impacts our youth overall.

This book is a must read, and I would go to the extreme and say if this is your thing, check out the entire Social Justice Series. I will be adding the other book that I have, that is also apart of this series, to my reading list. I am not exactly clear as to why I have not. But I will get there.

In addition, I would like to include that I am making this post in the middle of this coronavirus pandemic that we are currently experiencing. I hope that each and every one of you are being safe and practicing social distancing. As much as we might thing it is the flu or that we will recover, when something is unknown it is best to follow the guidelines given.

As always, if you would like to follow along, check out my [2020 Reading Challenge](2020-01-01-reading-list-2020.md) project. I will be adding more books to the list, as I find books that are interesting. There are some that I have and know that I will be adding. I just have not had the time to add them, as you can see with this late review.
