# Post Traumatic Slave Syndrome

Heyyyy! So here we are about to end the first month of the New Year. It went extremely fast and I am so happy to say that I am currently on my third book for the year. Yeah.....that's right. My third book....*hits the dougie*. However, I have had absolutely zero time to come and update with reviews of each of my readings thus far. Work has been chaotic after the holidays! You have to also remember, I am learning to manage this site while reading when work allows, and posting my reviews as I go. So making changes and posting is not exactly first nature just yet. But I am getting there.

Anywhoo, Post Traumatic Slave Syndrome is a book that I purchased sometime mid last year, I believe. This book was recommended to me by a woman in a Facebook group I'm in. Based on the topics we discuss and her depth, I figured it would be a good read. I just did not get around to it, as I have been putting reading off for years now. Which sucks, because it used to be an all the time thing. Now, not so much. But I blame work *rolls eyes*. Well, I decided to start this one over, since it was already in progress. Since work was quiet the first week of the month, due to the holidays, I was able to spend time and breeze through it. Boy am I glad I did. This is an awesome read.

First and foremost, I enjoy a book that takes historical traditions or significant events such as slavery, and maps them to behaviors that we see in modern society. I am always amazed at the number of people that understand PTSD, understand how mental health diseased is passed down from generation to generation, but cannot for the LOVE OF ME understand how something as traumatic as slavery can be at the root of a lot of dysfunctional behaviors and beliefs we see in the African American community today....I mean....1 + 1 = 2 and always will. It's not that difficult to comprehend.

There were 2 things that Dr. Joy did that I absolutely loved. The first was use her own experiences, whether it be herself, child, friend in some of her scenarios. The second is including a section of the book for what needs to be done to heal. Of course this was done at a high level. I am quite sure that each solution provided could be a book on it's own, but whether it's a discussion, book, article, podcast, whatever....it gets tiring to hear individuals regurgitate the problem without providing a solution. The solution does not have to be complete, but there should be something to start, something to get your mind going. And I thought she did just that.

This was my first book of hers, but I also heard that she travels and does a lot of lectures that are really good. I did look this up when I heard about it and may circle back and check when I have a moment. I would love to hear her speak in person. I would recommend this book to anyone who is interested learning about multigenerational trauma. Honestly, I would not have been mad if this was a requirement in one of my high school english courses back in the day. Considering the current state of our educational system, I know I am reaching with that one though lol

As far as my reading challenge, it has been going well. I mean....I am on book number 3 *flips hair*. I will post about my second book, which was a slight disappointment, this weekend.

If you would like to follow along, check out my [2020 Reading Challenge](2020-01-01-reading-list-2020.md) project. I have to add some new books I purchased to the list. I'll get there. I don't want a hard goal, but to start I am shooting for a min of 2 books per month. As always, feel free to suggest books to me, that you enjoyed and align with my reading criteria. Ciao!
