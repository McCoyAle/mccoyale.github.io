<h1 class="title">2020 Reading List</h1>

This is the first time I am attempting a reading challenge. I've always been passionate about reading books, but work has taken that away from me. This year, I have decided to challenge myself by reading between 20 and 25 books for the year, that are not related to tech. I am sure this will be pretty difficult, but you have to start somewhere.

I am going to carry over one book that I started reading in 2019, *Post Traumatic Slave Syndrome* by Dr. Joy Degruy. Due to studying for work, I have been unable to complete it. I plan to go back and read a few chapter over and then go from there. It really has been a good book, time just has not allowed me to complete it.

I have selected the books that meet some of the following criteria:

{% highlight raw %}
1. African American/African Autobiography
2. African American/African History
3. African American/African author
4. Is not pertaining to software or anything tech.
{% endhighlight %}
