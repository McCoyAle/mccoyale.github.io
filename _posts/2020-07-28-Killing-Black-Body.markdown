# Killing the Black Body Review

Ummm, I am not even done with this book. But since I was posting other late updates I decided I would go on ahead and start this one. It is *THAT* darn good. I am approximately halfway through and this is definitely a book that I'd suggest taking your time to read. It is heavily cited with facts and the references for said facts provided. My kind of read.

Now, let me be the first to say, I am a huge advocate for women's rights, issues in the black community, and doing honest assessments of where the American system stands. This also includes critiquing our criminal justice system. I am certain we all love American and there's not a place we'd rather be...besides on a Caribbean Island outside of hurricane season lol. But to say that we do not have major flaws that need to be fixed would be an understatement and a blatant lie.

This book breaks down what it means to really be liberated in terms of black feminism. I can admit that when this book was suggested to me I was not sure what to expect. But there are some individuals that can recommend something and you just trust it. The author does a superb job of breaking down each topic in a way that drives home the point for the reader. The book transitions from the history of the usage of the black body for American agendas and progresses from slavery up to modern day.

One of my favorite parts is the section about birth control. If you are into feminism and understand the history of birth control and how Planned Parenthood ties into it, then likely you know who Margaret Sanger is. What made this book different for me is the author takes an unbiased stance and introduces black activists who voiced certain beliefs that tied or *"confirmed"* Sanger's agenda. Some believe she was a racist and other's believe that she use the eugenics movement in order to push forward her own movement. Neither is better than the other to me but I do believe it is important to mention both. It also talks briefly about how black doctors were used in the facilities to gain trust from the black community. We all know the history of the medical field in relation to the black community and our lack of trust for it. The actual breakdown of it I am not sure a lot of books really touch on. At least, I don't read anything specifically about her, so it's usually discussed at a high level. I enjoyed the additional information given in this book. It is making me rethink adding my favorite book *Medical Apartheid* to the list, as this is a book I will probably reread forever.

We are all aware, well...most of us are, that birth control is not good for the body. The chapters on Norplant and Depo Provera that go into how they are bad and different incentives and processes provided to doctors to force patients to use it despite its negative side effects. This includes making it a stipulation in court rulings. The audacity! Speaking of court, the chapter I am currently reading discusses criminalizing mothers that give birth to children positive for drugs. At a high level many of these decisions sound appropriate to the average person that lacks awareness. But the book really breaks down and scrutinizes why it is not and how it is biased against minorities and lower income women.

An added bonus and then I am going to end for the night is that I learned something new about my little old town. I reside in a small town in North Carolina called Goldsboro. East of Raleigh, NC. We have hospital here that apparently was an Asylum for African Americans and partook in the sterilization of approx. 2,000 patients. Who would have thought? Especially since I recently read about a case a month ago or so, where NC has a history of unethically sterilizing people. Whew.....

I know this is one of my longest reviews. That is crazy since I am only halfway through the book lol But it is really good and I believe my favorite thus far. I would definitely put it in my favorite read list over all. I promise to come back and discuss how I enjoyed the *second half* of the book, because I highly doubt this is going to all of a sudden go bad.

Any-who, If you would like to follow along, check out my [2020 Reading Challenge](_posts/2020-01-01-reading-list-2020.md) project. Feel free to suggest new readings as well. Not sure my list for the year has hit 20 yet. I don't think I will make 20 books as work has picked up but I am enjoying my readings and getting back to something that I really enjoy outside of work.
