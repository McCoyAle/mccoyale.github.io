# We're Going to Need More Wine

Okay, I am going to say I needed some more wine after this one. I absolutely LOOOOOOVVVVED this book. Not many are a fan of Gabrielle Union. I am *go figure*. Her memoir made me love her even more. She has always appeared to be beautiful, confident, self assured, and a go getter to me. Her memoir confirmed all of my feelings. Now, I don't get into people's relationships, because I mean, love is not simple. And it is easy to say what you will or won't do when you do not have all the facts and are looking from the outside. So keep your opinions *to yo self*!!!!!

Any-who, I can say that I simply appreciate her story. Being someone who has their own story I can relate to another person that has one and owns it, opposed to allowing their story to own them. I always try to meet people where they're at in their moment of thinking, and understand that everyone has their own way of coping whether it makes sense to me or not. Life is a journey and full of lessons. It is up to us to analyze said lessons and apply them during future decision making moments. For me Gabrielle's story represents just that. The manner in which the book is written displays it as well. Each chapter starts with a story of her past and ends with the lesson learned, from childhood stories up until adult hood. Many of the stories told help you to understand who she is today and how that lesson shaped her.

I believe my favorite part of the book was the lack of respectability politics and her unapologetic truths. Not many people, especially of a certain status, are able to admit some of the truths. I know from experience how uncomfortable it can be to admit some of my own truths out of fear of judgement. The level of transparency that she gave us was truly inspiring. Especially in a society where women are now wanting to step out of many of the traditions society has held us imprisoned to. It is nice to see women with large audiences help that process move forward. I would definitely recommend this book.

If you would like to follow along, check out my [2020 Reading Challenge](_posts/2020-01-01-reading-list-2020.md) project. I have a couple of new reads that I need to add to my list. I am way behind, but I won't focus on that. I can only do what I can do. And I finally passed my certification exam. The exam that got me started on this Jekyll/GitHub blog. So that is definitely a huge goal accomplished and I hope to get back on track here.
