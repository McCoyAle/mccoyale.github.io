# Merry New Year's Eve!!!!

Hello, and thank you for visiting my blog page. A couple of weeks ago I was supposed
to be studying for my Kubernetes exam. I ran into a blog post that provided steps for
using Vargrant to provision VMs and install Kube using kubeadm. Thank you to my ADD,
I really liked the site and realized they were using Github Pages to document the steps.
I did some more research, instead of studying, and decided to start up a site myself.

So here I am today, on New Year's Eve, drafting my first blog. I am a member of this FB
for black women. We discuss various topics and one of them is different books members in
the group are reading. So I decided to start my own challenge. I am challenging myself to
read 20 to 25 books for 2020.

I read a lot for work and occasionally work long hours. I also have a toddler (2.5) now. Long
before I had a toddler, I stopped reading as much as I used to. I hope to push myself to
read more and also keep track of my progress. Since I enjoy playing around with different
technology, and I had a random domain with Google Domains, I decided to setup this Blog
site and use it to track my progress for this challenge.

I have never done a challenge before, so I will make up the rules along the way and see
how it goes. If you would like to follow along, check out my 2020 Reading Challenge project.
