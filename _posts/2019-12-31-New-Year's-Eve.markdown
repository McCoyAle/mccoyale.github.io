# Merry New Year's Eve!!!!

Heyyyy! Thank you for visiting my blog page. A couple of weeks ago, I was supposed
to be studying for my Kubernetes exam. I ran into this blog that went through steps for
using Vargrant to provision VMs. The VMs were used to install Kube using kubeadm. Thanks 
to my ADD, I was more focused on the blog site. I really liked the site and realized 
they were simply using Github Pages and Jekyll.I did some more research, instead of 
studying, and decided to try out a site using one the the templates myself.

So, here I am today, on New Year's Eve, drafting my first blog. I am a member of this FB
for black women. We discuss various topics and one of them is different books the group
members are reading. So I decided to challenge myself to read 20 to 25 books for 2020.

I read a lot for work and occasionally work long hours. I also have a toddler (2.5) now. Long
before I had a toddler, I stopped reading as much as I used to. I am hoping to push myself to
read more and also keep track of my progress. Since I enjoy playing around with different
technology, and I had a random domain with Google, I decided to setup this Blog
site and use it to track my progress for this challenge.

I have never done a challenge before, so I will make up the rules along the way and see
how it goes. If you would like to follow along, check out my [2020 Reading Challenge](2020-01-01-reading-list-2020.markdown) project.
Feel free to suggest any readings that meet the criteria I am trying to stick to.
