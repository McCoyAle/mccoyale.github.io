<p>Thanks for stopping by. I am Alexandra. I am Addi's mom first and a tech
enthusiast second. I enjoy learning about the latest software and tools, and then
helping others to do the same. I have worked on tech projects as a business
analyst, developer in test, and technical support engineer. I find that technical
support has been my favorite, outside of being on call. It feeds my curiosity
and allows me to utilize my interpersonal skills.</p>

<p>I am a New Yorker at heart, who currently resides in North Carolina with my
daughter and fianc√©. I currently work at a startup based out of the Silicone
Valley area. We specialize in virtualizing networking and storage features, that
are bundled with Kubernetes and Docker, to provide enterprise customers with a
plug and play Kuberentes environment in their on-site data centers.</p>

<p>I was studying for my Kubernetes certification exam when I ran into Github
Pages and Jekyll projects. I have decided to read more books outside of work and
tech, and thought coupling this project with blogging about books that I read
would help the process. I hope that you enjoy, and please do not hesitate to
contact me using any method if there are any questions or suggestions! </p>
