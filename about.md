<p>Thanks for stopping by. I am Alexandra, a tech
enthusiast, but Addi's mom first!! I enjoy learning about the latest software and
tools, and then helping others to do the same. I have worked on tech projects as
a business analyst, developer in test, and technical support engineer. I find that
technical support has been my favorite, outside of being on call. It feeds my
curiosity and allows me to utilize my interpersonal skills.</p>

<p>I am a New Yorker at heart, who currently resides in North Carolina with my
daughter and fianc√©. I currently work at a startup based out of the Silicone
Valley area. We specialize in virtualizing networking and storage features, that
are bundled with Kubernetes and Docker, to provide enterprise customers with a
plug and play Kubernetes environment in on-site data centers.</p>

<p>I was studying for my Kubernetes certification exam when I ran into Github
Pages and Jekyll projects (ADD Much!!!). Since I had decided to read more books
outside of work and tech, I thought coupling this project with blogging about books
that I read would be the best of both worlds. I hope that you enjoy my reviews
and they encourage you to, if not read, do what you enjoy more. Please do not
hesitate to leave a comment or contact me using any method if there are any
questions or suggestions!!! </p>
